# Well-rounded countries
Which country (based on mean value from all indicators) is the most "complete" among them?


World Gov + Information is Beautiful competition

Based on public data provided by World Gov and Information is Beautiful.
Data sets were rescaled in a way that "1" was assigned to the lowest value, and "7" to the highest value. In-between values have been grouped, proportionally, into bins. Some data (such as unemployment rate) have the bins reversed, with "7" being the lowest value, and "1" being the highest.
